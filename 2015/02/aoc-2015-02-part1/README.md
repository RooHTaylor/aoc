The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?

The example-input.txt file should give the answer 101 sq ft

### Usage
```bash
cargo run -- "<input file>"
