This year is the Reindeer Olympics! Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.

Reindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.

Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?

The example-input.txt input should give the answer 1120 with 1000 iterations.

### Usage
```bash
cargo run -- "<input file>" [iterations] [--debug]
```
