# Advent of Code (AoC)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Collection of advent of code challenges written in various programming languages. I
started this in 2025, going all the way back to the initial 2015 AoC year. In the 
beginning I was learning Rust, so the inital challanges are all written in Rust.
However, I may choose to use other languages as time goes on.

### Completion

### Structure

In general the file structure will follow the following structure. Expections may 
apply, depending on the requirements of the challange. The real-input.txt files 
will always be omitted. Any processed data (for example caches written to disk) 
will also be omitted. The code should generate this data anyways.

```
./<year>/<day>/part[1|2]/
./<year>/<day>/example-input.txt
```
